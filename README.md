Emotion Detection


In this project our goal is to create a emotion detection system, trained on the Twitter Data.

The initial input is raw text data from the tweets. We have to train the model to classify the text. Set of the possible labels is {"Angry", "Sad","Joy","Fear"}

For this project we will use Python programming language, specifically its data preprocessing library pandas and it's ML library scikit-learn. In order to get the data we will use Twitter's api.
