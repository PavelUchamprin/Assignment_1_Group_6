1. **(1.25/1.5)** - The Description is OK, but quite short on any details. -0.25
2. **(1.5/1.5)** - Perfect. I assumed that the Product Goal is issue #7. It should not have been close,d though.
3. **(1.5/1.5)** - Perfect
4. **(0.0/1.5)** - No Description or Acceptance Criteria were created for any issues in the two Milestones.
5. **(1.5/1.5)** - Perfect. Avoid the usage of ill-defined words such as *promptly*" in a working agreement document. The definiition of promptly varies from individual to individual. Use language akin to "within X hours" instead.
6. **(1.25/1.5)** - Almost Perfect. The WA was great. However, The DoD was quite short. It should, at least, have had an item such as "meet the acceptance criteria".
